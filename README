string-bazaar is usered for feed windows manager status bar. I use it in dmw or i3

== How To use it:

1) Copy software into a directory <path>
git clone git://github.com/angal/string-bazaar.git
          
2) Use it:

for dwm write into .xinitrc this line:
exec <path>/string-bazaar/dwm-bazaar

for i3 write in ~/.i3/config 
bar {
   status_command ~/string-bazaar/string-bazaar
}
